# Obstacle Avoiding Robot Code Readme

## Overview

This Arduino code is for a simple obstacle-avoiding robot using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and a servo motor for scanning. The robot moves forward until an obstacle is detected, at which point it stops, scans its surroundings, moves backwards, turns left, and then resumes forward movement.

## Hardware Requirements

*   Arduino board
*   HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
*   Servo motor
*   Two DC motors with a motor driver circuit
*   Jumper wires
*   Power source

## Connections

*   **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:**
    *   `VCC` to 5V
    *   `GND` to GND
    *   `Trig` to Arduino digital pin 9
    *   `Echo` to Arduino digital pin 8
*   **Servo Motor:**
    *   `Signal` to Arduino digital pin 10
    *   `VCC` to 5V
    *   `GND` to GND
*   **DC Motors (via Motor Driver):**
    *   Left Motor:
        *   `MLa` to Arduino digital pin 4
        *   `MLb` to Arduino digital pin 5
    *   Right Motor:
        *   `MRa` to Arduino digital pin 6
        *   `MRb` to Arduino digital pin 7
